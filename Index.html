            <H2><b>Personal Information</b></H2>
            <p>I am a rather private and reserved person who enjoys the company of small intimate groups than large gatherings.
              I enjoy road trip exploration and would very much like to take up hiking and extended camping in the Australian
              bush/outback pack mule pioneer style, with a small group or alone.  This would be great for my secondary interest
              of star gazing, and what better view can you get then from a total non-light polluted Australian sky ðŸ˜Š<align:"justify"></P>

              <h2><b>Education</b></h2>
              <p>Primarily my formal education to date is Tafe/College level with qualifications in HVAC as trade certified, and
                Facilities Management which was a correspondence course.  Other than that, all my education is through life
                lessons at the school of hard knocks.<align:"justify"></p>

                <h2><b>Interest In IT</b></h2>
                <p>I wont bore the reader with all the types of employment, trials and tribulations that I have had in-between then and now, but in my most recent career in facilities management  I typically use software and platforms to streamline work for the team and improve how we work.  Using software like Excel (Formula mainly, but VBA/macros where possible, Smartsheet etc.  Disclaimer I am no expert in either but love to learn so I research how the formula/code works in different scenarios, and develop to suit my application which I actually enjoy when designing something that would benefit the team and progress my own skills.
                  I would very much like to take the experience I have within FM, and mechanical and electrical trades and take it to the next level by incorporating IT and programming strength to work within a more software design and development role working on software and tools to improve the industry and staff/client experience.  So I am hoping to get a good grounding in general IT, database management networking, Programming and even web design from my course with RMIT.
                  <br>
                  <br>The choice to study online with RMIT is purely coincidental, and was one of the courses for IT and programming that was available for online study - ðŸ˜‰
                  <br>
                  <br>Ultimately, I have two high level goals
                  <br>1.	Progression to a field that I will enjoy and take my experiences to create and develop useful tools
                  <br>2.	Gain useful skills that can challenge me in a new way

                        <P><B>MEDIATOR (INFP) STRENGTHS</B><BR><BR>
                              <I><B>Empathetic</b></i> - Mediators donâ€™t just care about other people in an abstract sense. These personalities can actually feel another personâ€™s emotions, from joy and elation to sorrow and regret. Because of this sensitivity, Mediators tend to be thoughtful and kindhearted, and they hate the idea of hurting anyone, even unintentionally.<BR><BR>
                              <I><B>Generous</b></i> - Mediators rarely enjoy succeeding at other peopleâ€™s expense. They feel called to share the good things in their lives, give credit where itâ€™s due, and uplift the people around them. These personalities want to contribute to a world where every voice is heard and no oneâ€™s needs go unmet.<BR><BR>
                              <I><B>Open-Minded</b></i> â€“ Tolerant and accepting, Mediators try not to judge anyone elseâ€™s beliefs, lifestyles, or decisions. This is a personality type that prefers compassion to fault-finding, and many Mediators feel empathy even for those who have done wrong. Because theyâ€™re so accepting, Mediators often become confidants for their friends and loved ones â€“ and occasionally for total strangers.  <BR><BR>
                              <I><B>Creative</b></i> â€“ Mediators love to see things from unconventional perspectives. Few things give them more pleasure than allowing their minds to wander through all sorts of ideas and possibilities and daydreams. Itâ€™s no wonder, then, that many Mediators are drawn to creative pursuits â€“ or that this personality type is well represented among writers and artists.<BR><BR>
                              <I><B>Passionate</b></i> â€“ When an idea or movement captures their imagination, Mediators want to give their whole heart to it. People with this personality type may not always be outspoken, but that doesnâ€™t diminish their strong feelings for a cause that speaks to their beliefs and convictions.<BR><BR>
                              <I><B>Idealistic</b></i> â€“ Mediators strive to follow their conscience, even when doing the right thing isnâ€™t easy or convenient. They rarely lose sight of their desire to live a meaningful, purpose-filled life â€“ one that helps others and leaves the world a better place.    <BR><BR>
                        <P><B>MEDIATOR (INFP) WEAKNESSES</B><BR><BR>
                              <I><B>Unrealistic</b></i> - â€“ Nothing in this world is perfect â€“ and that can be a difficult truth for Mediators to accept. People with this personality type can be hopeless romantics, with rose-colored visions of what their lives should be like. This can set Mediators up for disappointment when reality inevitably falls short of their dreams.<BR><BR>
                              <I><B>Self Isolating</b></i> â€“ Mediators long to connect with others, but they donâ€™t always know how. Especially in new environments, Mediators may be reluctant to put themselves out there in ways that would help them make new friends or become involved in a new community. As a result, people with this personality type may sometimes feel lonely or isolated.  <BR><BR>
                              <I><B>Unfocused</b></i> â€“ Mediatorsâ€™ imaginative, introspective nature doesnâ€™t always lend itself to productivity. Many Mediators get frustrated by how difficult they find it to buckle down and get things done. The problem isnâ€™t that they are incapable â€“ rather, itâ€™s that they run into problems when they become so caught up in different ideas and ideals that they fail to commit to a course of action.<BR><BR>
                            <br>

                        <h3><b>Personality Profile Reflection</b></h3>
                        <p>The 16 personalities survey results are uncannily accurate, and I do see a lot of the results in myself.  Example of one Strength and one Weakness;
                          <br><b>Generous</b>.  I dislike praise or compliment to myself, instead I measure my success based on how well my team are performing, how they feel achievement and acknowledgement from client on their work, and when they feel a good sense of accomplishment from confidence.
                          <br><b>Self-Isolating</b>.  I am more comfortable in small intimate groups, rather than large unfocussed noise events, and I am quite comfortable in my own company or with one or two others when working on a project or activity.  That is not to say that I cannot handle large meetings, projects or works, as that is my normal day, but I am more comfortable in smaller settings.</P>

                              <p>To be clear, this is not a unique and new style of platform, but rather an interpretation of existing platforms that do exist such as</p>
                              <ul>
                                <li>Pinnacle</li>
                                <li>Emaint</li>
                                <li>Maximo</li>
                              </ul>
                              <p>To name a very few CMMS (Computerised, maintenance, management system) that are in the market.  There are plenty more on all kinds of platforms from desktop based, to web/network, through to smartphone applications to choose from.<br>
                              <br>Some CMMS are designed bespoke for the client company to meet their needs.  As an example my current employer CBRE  utilises Service Insight 7 for our client account asset management.  Knightfrank, another Real Estate and Facilities service provider  also uses a bespoke CMMS platform called Facilities Response Centre (FRC) to support their clients.<br>
                              <br>Operations FM is a constantly changing market, especially with the advent of the Covid 19 Pandemic and the way clients are  looking at real estate and its usage.  Our client account has seen moves towards constricting the office workspace SQM with the new norm of working from home, and staff only attending site offices for corroboration activities.  This the client is planning on managing  by a dedicated  booking system for seating in advance.  <br></p>

                                <p>Utilisation data will be collected based on access control and booking system above.  This data will be in a reportable format for client review and recommendations.
                                  <br><br>Business Operating System for Space (BOSS) Business Operating System for Space is an existing functional booking application that can be rolled out immediately.  However from internal programming tools required I lack the experience just yet in programming to be able to determine the language and frontend that would be purposed for this.  So this part will be a work in progress as my experience improves.</p>

                                  <p>This project is more advanced at this stage than what I am, so this will be part of a ongoing development plan.  I am hoping to develop the above to work within full bespoke CMMS and control platform that interfaces asset management, financial platforms, Bookings, helpdesk, property management, security access and communications to name a few ideas I have for full GUI system.  </p>
